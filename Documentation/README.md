## 🆕 Dual Randomization System (November 2025)

**Evolution:**
- **Phase 1:** Greedy algorithm → 70% success
- **Phase 2:** Time slot shuffling → 85% success
- **Phase 3:** Added section shuffling → 92% success
- **Phase 4:** Added semester priority swap → 100% success ✅

**Key Innovation:**
```
Randomization Dimensions:
1. Time Slot Order (smart diversity shuffle)
2. Section Order (3A/B/C and 5A/B/C shuffled)
3. Semester Priority (50% 3rd first, 50% 5th first)
4. Always keep 7th semester last

Search Space: 10,800 unique combinations
Success Rate: 100% (usually attempt 1-3)
```

**Pattern Analysis Discovery:**
- Studied successful runs (attempts 7, 13, 16)
- Discovered day diversity critical (5th sem across 4+ days)
- Found 15:00-17:00 "escape valve" essential
- Realized section order impacts slot distribution
- Concluded semester priority needs flexibility

**Result:** From 20+ attempts to achieve 85% → 1-3 attempts to achieve 100%

## 🎓 Key Learnings & Insights

### Algorithm Design

**1. Constraint Hierarchy Matters**  
Schedule from most restrictive to most flexible:
- Fixed slots (no flexibility) → Labs (2-hour blocks) → Theory (1-hour, flexible)
- This order minimizes conflicts and backtracking

**2. Defer Resource Assignment**  
Separate "WHEN" (scheduling) from "WHERE/WHO" (resources):
- Steps 1-4: Schedule time slots
- Steps 5-6: Assign resources (classrooms, teachers)
- Easier to rerun just resource assignment without rescheduling

**3. Global vs Local Conflicts**  
- **Global**: Same resource, same time, different sections (needs cross-section tracking)
- **Local**: Within one section (easier to detect)
- Solution: In-memory global trackers for rooms and teachers

**4. Multi-Segment Time Slots**  
When working with 30-minute granularity:
- 1-hour slot = 2 segments (check BOTH before assigning)
- 1.5-hour slot = 3 segments (check ALL before assigning)
- Generalize: `numSegments = Math.ceil(duration * 2)`
- Mark ALL segments as occupied after assignment

**5. Batch Rotation Formula**  
Mathematical guarantee of fairness:
```
labIndex = (round + batchNum - 1) % totalLabs
```
Every batch rotates through all labs across weeks.

**6. Divide-and-Rule for Balance**  
Instead of sequential day filling (Monday → Friday):
- Divide subjects into 5 equal groups
- Distribute one group per day
- Result: Even daily load (no heavy/light days)

---

### Frontend Architecture

**1. Two-Layer Caching Strategy**  
- **Parent Cache:** Component state (manual invalidation)
- **Child Cache:** EmptyCell local state (version-based auto-refresh)
- **Coordination:** Version counter increments trigger child refresh

**2. Cache Invalidation is Critical**  
Must clear cache at EVERY mutation point:
- Slot moved → Clear old position cache
- Classroom changed → Clear slot's time cache
- Slot deleted → Clear position cache
- Miss one spot → Stale data bugs

**3. State Update Order Matters**  
Correct order:
1. Update timetable state (increments version)
2. Clear relevant cache keys
3. EmptyCell detects version change
4. EmptyCell auto-refreshes

Wrong order (version before state) → Child doesn't detect change

**4. Progressive Disclosure**  
Don't show editing features until Step 5 is complete:
- Prevents confusion
- Guides users through correct workflow
- Reduces errors

**5. Clear Over Clever**  
Explicit classroom badges > Hover-to-reveal buttons:
- Users struggled with hover-to-show "Change Room" button
- Solution: Made badges clickable directly
- Result: More intuitive, less irritating

**6. Undo is Essential**  
Every edit action must be undoable:
- Users make mistakes
- Experimenting is important
- Undo/Redo builds confidence

**7. Modal Size Matters**  
Started with fullscreen modals → Users wanted 70% centered:

**Interactive Editing Enhancements**
- Theory slots remain draggable after Step 5
- Click classroom badge to change rooms
- Real-time conflict detection
- Undo/Redo for all changes
- Unsaved changes tracking

**User Experience Improvements**
- Step results persist across page navigation
- Clear future steps when re-running a step
- Compact 70% modal dialogs
- Clickable classroom badges (no hover expansion)
- Editing disabled until Step 5 complete

## 📞 Support & Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **"No rooms available"** → Check if Step 5 ran, rooms may be assigned
- **"Conflict detected"** → Another section using resource, choose different time
- **"Step results disappeared"** → Fixed in latest version, results persist
- **"Can't move slot"** → Fixed slots and labs are locked (by design)
- **"Cache showing stale data"** → Fixed Nov 12, version counter refreshes automatically

### Debug Mode
Enable console logging for detailed execution:
- **Backend**: Check terminal output during step execution
- **Frontend**: Open browser console (F12) for conflict logs, cache invalidation logs
