# 📋 ISE Department Timetable Constraints

This document outlines all the constraints and rules for generating timetables for the Information Science and Engineering (ISE) department at BIT.

---

## 🎓 **1. DEPARTMENT SCOPE CONSTRAINTS**

### 1.1 Semester Responsibility
**Rule:** ISE department manages only semesters 3-8 (3rd to 8th semester students).

**Reason:** First two semesters (1st & 2nd) are handled by a common department across all branches.

**Example:**
```
✅ Valid: Semester 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
❌ Invalid: Semester 1, 2
```

**Implementation:**
- `subjects_model.js`: `sem: { min: 3, max: 8 }`
- `syllabus_labs_model.js`: `lab_sem: { min: 3, max: 8 }`
- All timetable generation focuses on these 6 semesters only

---

### 1.2 Semester Type Separation (CRITICAL!)
**Rule:** Odd and Even semester timetables are COMPLETELY SEPARATE and generated at different times of the year.

**Academic Year Structure:**
```
First Half (Aug-Dec): ODD SEMESTERS
├── Semester 3 (Odd) - Sections: 3A, 3B, 3C
├── Semester 5 (Odd) - Sections: 5A, 5B, 5C
└── Semester 7 (Odd) - Sections: 7A, 7B, 7C

Second Half (Jan-May): EVEN SEMESTERS
├── Semester 4 (Even) - Sections: 4A, 4B, 4C
├── Semester 6 (Even) - Sections: 6A, 6B, 6C
└── Semester 8 (Even) - Sections: 8A, 8B, 8C
```

**Generation Scope:**
- **When generating ODD sems:** Include ONLY odd semester sections (3A, 3B, 3C, 5A, 5B, 5C, 7A, 7B, 7C)
- **When generating EVEN sems:** Include ONLY even semester sections (4A, 4B, 4C, 6A, 6B, 6C, 8A, 8B, 8C)
- **Never mix:** Odd and even semesters never run simultaneously

**Example:**
```
Admin Action: "Generate Timetable for Odd Semesters"

Algorithm processes:
├── ALL sections from Semester 3 (odd)
├── ALL sections from Semester 5 (odd)
├── ALL sections from Semester 7 (odd)
└── Generates conflict-free timetables for each section

Output:
├── Timetable for Section 3A ✅
├── Timetable for Section 3B ✅
├── Timetable for Section 3C ✅
├── Timetable for Section 5A ✅
├── Timetable for Section 5B ✅
├── Timetable for Section 5C ✅
├── Timetable for Section 7A ✅
├── Timetable for Section 7B ✅
└── Timetable for Section 7C ✅

All 9 timetables are globally conflict-free!
```

---

### 1.3 Timetable Generation Strategy (THE MAIN GOAL)
**Rule:** Generate SEPARATE timetable documents (one per section) in ONE algorithm run that checks conflicts across ALL sections.

**Main Goal:** **ALL CONFLICT-FREE TIMETABLES ACROSS ALL SECTIONS** ⭐

**Critical Requirements:**

**1. Cross-Section Teacher Conflict Prevention:**
```
Example:
Prof. DC teaches:
├── Data Structures → Section 3A
└── AI → Section 5A

❌ INVALID: DC scheduled at Monday 10-12 for BOTH 3A and 5A
✅ VALID: DC scheduled at Monday 10-12 for 3A, then Monday 2-4 for 5A

Algorithm MUST ensure:
- Prof. DC is never in two places at the same time
- Check ALL sections before assigning teacher to time slot
```

**2. Cross-Section Room Conflict Prevention:**
```
Example:
Lab Room ISE-301 assigned to:
├── Batch 3A1 (DSL Lab)
└── Batch 5B2 (CN Lab)

❌ INVALID: Both batches using ISE-301 at Monday 8-10 AM
✅ VALID: 3A1 uses ISE-301 Monday 8-10, 5B2 uses ISE-301 Tuesday 10-12

Algorithm MUST ensure:
- No lab room double-booking across ALL sections
- Check ALL sections before assigning room to time slot
```

**3. Cross-Section Theory Classroom Conflict Prevention:**
```
Example:
Classroom ISE-LH1 needed for:
├── Section 3B: DBMS Theory
└── Section 5A: AI Theory

❌ INVALID: Both sections using ISE-LH1 at Monday 10-12
✅ VALID: 3B uses ISE-LH1 Monday 10-12, 5A uses ISE-LH1 Tuesday 9-11

Algorithm MUST ensure:
- No classroom double-booking across ALL sections
- Check ALL sections before assigning classroom to time slot
```

**4. Individual Section Output:**
```
Output Structure:
├── One timetable document per section
├── Each timetable is complete and independent
├── But all timetables are globally conflict-free
└── Can be viewed/printed separately per section

Example:
- Section 3A timetable (standalone document)
- Section 3B timetable (standalone document)
- Section 5A timetable (standalone document)
... (all conflict-free when checked together)
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Phase 3 Algorithm
function generateTimetables(semesterType) {
  // Load ALL sections of this semester type
  const sections = getSections({ sem_type: semesterType })
  // Example for 'odd': [3A, 3B, 3C, 5A, 5B, 5C, 7A, 7B, 7C]
  
  // Generate timetables for ALL sections simultaneously
  // Conflict checking spans ALL sections
  const timetables = {}
  
  for (const section of sections) {
    timetables[section.id] = {
      section_id: section.id,
      section_name: section.name,
      sem: section.sem,
      theory_slots: [],
      lab_slots: []
    }
  }
  
  // Schedule activities checking conflicts across ALL sections
  scheduleAllActivities(timetables, sections)
  
  // Save each section's timetable as separate document
  for (const sectionId in timetables) {
    saveTimetable(timetables[sectionId])
  }
  
  return timetables
}
```

**Validation:**
```javascript
// Before assigning any resource (teacher/room/classroom) at a time slot
function canAssignResource(resource, timeSlot, currentSection, allSections) {
  // Check if resource is free across ALL sections at this time
  for (const section of allSections) {
    if (isResourceBusy(resource, timeSlot, section)) {
      return false // ❌ Conflict found!
    }
  }
  return true // ✅ Safe to assign
}
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero resource conflicts across all sections
- ✅ Realistic timetables (teachers can't be in two places)
- ✅ Efficient resource utilization
- ✅ Each section gets independent timetable document
- ✅ Easy to view/print per section
- ✅ Globally consistent and conflict-free

---

## 👥 **2. SECTION & BATCH CONSTRAINTS**

### 2.1 Section Structure
**Rule:** Each semester has multiple sections (A, B, C, etc.), each containing a fixed number of students.

**Example:**
```
Semester 3:
├── Section A: 60 students
├── Section B: 55 students
└── Section C: 58 students
```

### 2.2 Batch Division
**Rule:** Each section is divided into exactly 3 batches for lab purposes.

**Reason:** Lab rooms have limited capacity (~30 computers), requiring smaller groups for hands-on work.

**Example:**
```
Section 3A (60 students):
├── Batch 3A1: 20 students
├── Batch 3A2: 20 students
└── Batch 3A3: 20 students
```

**Implementation:**
- `ise_sections_model.js`: `num_batches: { type: Number, default: 3 }`
- Batch names include semester prefix: "3A1", "3A2", "3A3" (not just "A1", "A2", "A3")

### 2.3 Batch Naming Convention
**Rule:** Batch names must include semester number as prefix for global uniqueness.

**Example:**
```
✅ Correct: 3A1, 3A2, 3A3 (Semester 3, Section A, Batches 1-3)
❌ Wrong: A1, A2, A3 (ambiguous - which semester?)
```

**Reason:** Prevents confusion across semesters, enables easier tracking and reporting.

---

## 📚 **3. SUBJECT CONSTRAINTS**

### 3.1 Subject Categories
**Rule:** Subjects are categorized into 5 types based on teaching and scheduling requirements:

#### **Type 1: Regular Theory Subjects**
**Definition:** Core ISE curriculum subjects taught by ISE department faculty.

**Examples:** Data Structures, DBMS, AI, Computer Networks, Operating Systems

**Scheduling Requirements:**
- ✅ Requires ISE teacher assignment
- ✅ Requires classroom assignment (ISE department rooms)
- ✅ Requires time slot allocation
- ✅ Teacher workload counted

**Characteristics:**
```javascript
{
  requires_teacher_assignment: true,
  is_project: false,
  is_open_elective: false,
  is_professional_elective: false,
  is_non_ise_subject: false
}
```

---

#### **Type 2: Other Department Subjects**
**Definition:** Subjects taught by other departments (Math, Physics, Management, etc.) but attended by ISE students.

**Examples:** Mathematics-III, Engineering Physics, Business Management

**Scheduling Requirements:**
- ❌ NO ISE teacher assignment (other dept handles teacher)
- ✅ Requires classroom assignment (ISE dept reserves own classroom)
- ✅ Requires time slot allocation (ISE timetable reserves slot)
- ❌ NOT counted in ISE teacher workload

**Reason for Classification:** ISE students need the time slot and classroom reserved, but teaching is handled externally.

**Characteristics:**
```javascript
{
  requires_teacher_assignment: false,
  is_non_ise_subject: true,
  is_project: false,
  is_open_elective: false,
  is_professional_elective: false
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Timetable algorithm reserves time slot and classroom
- Display as "Subject: Math-III | Teacher: [Other Dept] | Room: ISE-601"

---

#### **Type 3: Project Subjects**
**Definition:** Self-directed student work with periodic reviews (no continuous teaching).

**Examples:** Minor Project, Major Project, Internship

**Scheduling Requirements:**
- ❌ NO teacher assignment (students work independently)
- ❌ NO classroom assignment (flexible - labs, library, groups)
- ✅ Requires time slot allocation (for periodic reviews/meetings)
- ❌ NOT counted in teacher workload

**Reason for Classification:** Projects require time allocation but not fixed teaching resources.

**Characteristics:**
```javascript
{
  requires_teacher_assignment: false,
  is_project: true,
  is_non_ise_subject: false,
  is_open_elective: false,
  is_professional_elective: false
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Timetable algorithm reserves time slot only
- Display as "Major Project | Monday 1:30-3:30 | No room assigned"

---

#### **Type 4: Open Elective Courses (OEC)**
**Definition:** College-wide electives offered to students from ALL departments, taught by offering department (may or may not be ISE).

**Examples:** Machine Learning (offered by CSE), IoT (offered by ECE), Blockchain (offered by ISE)

**Applicable To:** Semester 7 students only

**Scheduling Requirements:**
- ❌ NO ISE teacher assignment (offering dept handles teacher, even if ISE teaches it)
- ✅ Requires classroom assignment (ISE dept reserves own classroom for ISE students)
- ✅ Requires FIXED time slot (pre-decided, given as input)
- ❌ NOT counted in ISE teacher workload (even if ISE faculty teaches, it's separate from dept load)

**Reason for Classification:** 
- Inter-department course requiring coordination
- Time slots FIXED college-wide (so students from different branches can attend)
- ISE students attend at ISE-reserved classroom, but teaching managed separately

**Key Constraint - FIXED Time Slots:**
```
Input (given before generation):
├── OEC: Machine Learning
├── Fixed Time: Friday 1:30-3:30 PM (college-decided)
└── All sections (3A, 5A, 7A) choosing ML must attend at THIS time

Timetable Algorithm:
├── BLOCKS Friday 1:30-3:30 for Section 7A
├── Assigns ISE classroom (e.g., ISE-LH1)
└── Does NOT assign ISE teacher (handled by offering dept)
```

**Characteristics:**
```javascript
{
  requires_teacher_assignment: false,
  is_open_elective: true,
  fixed_time_slots: true,  // Pre-decided by college
  is_project: false,
  is_non_ise_subject: false,  // May or may not be ISE
  is_professional_elective: false
}
```

**Batch Handling:** All batches of section stay together (batch synchronization maintained).

---

#### **Type 5: Professional Elective Courses (PEC)**
**Definition:** ISE-specific electives where students choose from 2-3 options within ISE curriculum.

**Examples:** 
- Option A: Advanced AI
- Option B: Cloud Computing  
- Option C: Cyber Security

**Applicable To:** Semester 7 students only

**Scheduling Requirements:**
- ✅ Requires ISE teacher assignment (ISE faculty teaches)
- ✅ Requires classroom assignment (ISE department rooms)
- ✅ Requires FIXED time slot (pre-decided, given as input)
- ✅ Counted in ISE teacher workload

**Reason for Classification:**
- Choice-based within ISE department
- Multiple options must run in PARALLEL at SAME time (so students can't be in two places)
- Time slots FIXED to ensure parallel scheduling

**Key Constraint - FIXED Parallel Slots:**
```
Input (given before generation):
├── PEC Slot: Monday 10:30-12:30 (fixed for all PEC options)
├── Section 7A students: 
│   ├── 20 students choose Advanced AI
│   ├── 25 students choose Cloud Computing
│   └── 15 students choose Cyber Security
└── All 3 options run at SAME time in DIFFERENT rooms

Timetable Algorithm:
├── BLOCKS Monday 10:30-12:30 for Section 7A
├── Assigns 3 classrooms: ISE-601, ISE-602, ISE-603
├── Assigns 3 ISE teachers (one per option)
└── Students attend based on their choice
```

**Characteristics:**
```javascript
{
  requires_teacher_assignment: true,
  is_professional_elective: true,
  fixed_time_slots: true,  // Pre-decided for parallel scheduling
  is_project: false,
  is_open_elective: false,
  is_non_ise_subject: false
}
```

**Batch Handling:** All batches of section stay together (batch synchronization maintained). Choice is individual, not batch-based.

### 3.2 Summary: Scheduling Requirements by Type

| Subject Type | ISE Teacher? | Classroom? | Time Slot? | Workload Count? | Fixed Slot? |
|--------------|-------------|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Regular Theory** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (flexible) | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Other Dept** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (reserved) | ✅ Yes (flexible) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **Project** | ❌ No | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (flexible) | ❌ No | ❌ No |
| **OEC (Sem 7)** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (reserved) | ✅ Yes (FIXED) | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **PEC (Sem 7)** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes (FIXED) | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |

**Key Insights:**
- **Regular Theory:** Full ISE control, flexible scheduling
- **Other Dept + OEC:** Reserve resources, teaching external
- **Project:** Time only, no fixed resources
- **PEC:** Full ISE control BUT with fixed time constraint
- **Batch Sync:** Applies to ALL types (batches always together in time)

---

### 3.3 Theory Subject Scheduling Rules
**Rule:** Theory subjects have flexible scheduling based on `hrs_per_week` and `max_hrs_per_day` constraints.

**Database Fields:**
```javascript
{
  subject_name: "Data Structures",
  hrs_per_week: 3,        // Total hours needed per week
  max_hrs_per_day: 2      // Maximum hours in one day
}
```

**Scheduling Strategy:**

**Example 1: 3 hrs/week, max 2 hrs/day**
```
Option A (Consecutive):
├── Monday: 9:00-11:00 (2 hours)
├── Wednesday: 10:00-11:00 (1 hour)
└── Total: 3 hours ✅

Option B (Split differently):
├── Monday: 9:00-10:00 (1 hour)
├── Wednesday: 10:00-12:00 (2 hours)
└── Total: 3 hours ✅

✅ Both valid - algorithm decides based on convenience
```

**Example 2: 4 hrs/week, max 2 hrs/day**
```
Option A:
├── Monday: 9:00-11:00 (2 hours)
├── Thursday: 2:00-4:00 (2 hours)
└── Total: 4 hours ✅

Option B:
├── Tuesday: 9:00-11:00 (2 hours)
├── Wednesday: 10:00-11:00 (1 hour)
├── Friday: 2:00-3:00 (1 hour)
└── Total: 4 hours ✅

✅ Both valid - flexible split
```

**Invalid Example:**
```
Subject: DBMS (4 hrs/week, max 2 hrs/day)

❌ Monday: 9:00-1:00 (4 hours) - Violates max_hrs_per_day!
❌ Week total: 5 hours - Exceeds hrs_per_week!
```

**Key Rules:**
- ✅ Total weekly hours MUST equal `hrs_per_week`
- ✅ Any single day session CANNOT exceed `max_hrs_per_day`
- ✅ Sessions can be consecutive or split across different days
- ✅ Algorithm decides optimal split based on:
  - Available time slots
  - Teacher availability
  - Classroom availability
  - Minimizing gaps in student schedule

**Batch Handling for Theory:**
- ✅ All batches (3A1, 3A2, 3A3) attend together as ONE section
- ✅ Full section (e.g., 60 students) in ONE large classroom
- ❌ Cannot split batches into different rooms for theory

**Implementation:**
- Store `max_hrs_per_day` in subjects model
- Algorithm checks: daily_hours ≤ max_hrs_per_day
- Algorithm ensures: Σ(all sessions) = hrs_per_week

---

### 3.4 Subject Shortforms
**Rule:** Every subject must have a shortform for compact display.

**Example:**
```
Subject: Data Structures
├── Code: BCS301
├── Shortform: DS ✅
└── Display in UI: "DS" instead of "BCS301"
```

**Reason:** Improves readability in compact UIs, easier for users to identify subjects quickly.

---

### 3.5 Subject Field Naming Convention ⚠️
**Critical Implementation Detail:** Subject model uses prefixed field names.

**Database Schema:**
```javascript
subject_sem: { type: Number }      // NOT "sem"
subject_sem_type: { type: String } // NOT "sem_type"
```

**Common Mistake:**
```javascript
❌ WRONG: subject.sem === section.sem
✅ CORRECT: subject.subject_sem === section.sem

❌ WRONG: subject.sem_type === section.sem_type
✅ CORRECT: subject.subject_sem_type === section.sem_type
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Filters will return empty arrays if wrong field names used
- No error thrown - silently fails with zero results
- Always use prefixed names when filtering subjects

**Implementation Checklist:**
- ✅ Use `subject.subject_sem` for semester filtering
- ✅ Use `subject.subject_sem_type` for odd/even filtering
- ✅ Use `subject.subject_code` for subject code
- ✅ Use `subject.subject_name` for subject name
- ✅ Use `subject.subject_shortform` for display

---

## 🧪 **4. LAB CONSTRAINTS**

### 4.1 Lab Equipment Requirements
**Rule:** Labs have specific equipment/software requirements that limit which physical rooms can be used.

**Reason:** Not all lab rooms are equipped equally. Some labs need special software, hardware, or tools.

**Real Example from College:**
```
DV Lab (Data Visualization):
├── Requirements: Graphics cards, visualization software
├── Compatible Rooms: 612A, 612B, 612C, 604A ✅
└── Incompatible Rooms: General labs without graphics software ❌

DVP Lab (Data Visualization Project):
├── Requirements: Project tools, collaboration software
├── Compatible Rooms: 612A, 612C, 604A ✅
└── Incompatible Rooms: 612B (lacks project tools) ❌

DSL Lab (Data Structures):
├── Requirements: Basic programming environment
├── Compatible Rooms: ANY general-purpose lab ✅
└── No special equipment needed
```

**Impact on System:**
- Lab room assignment CANNOT be automated
- Admin must manually select rooms in Phase 2
- System must filter available rooms based on lab type

**Implementation:**
- `dept_labs_model.js`: `lab_subjects_handled` array defines which labs a room supports
- UI shows only compatible rooms in dropdown for each lab

### 4.2 Lab Teacher Requirement
**Rule:** Lab sessions should ideally have 2 teachers supervising, but can function with 1 teacher if necessary.

**Reason:** Two teachers provide better supervision quality and hands-on assistance, but flexibility is needed to accommodate teacher availability constraints.

**Priority Order:**
1. **Ideal:** 2 qualified teachers ✅✅ (preferred)
2. **Acceptable:** 1 qualified teacher ✅ (if 2nd not available)
3. **Flagged:** 0 teachers ⚠️ (needs admin attention)

**Example:**
```
Lab Session: Data Structures Lab (DSL)
├── Batch 3A1
├── Scenario A (Ideal): Teacher 1: DC + Teacher 2: AK ✅✅
├── Scenario B (Acceptable): Teacher 1: DC only ✅
└── Scenario C (Needs Review): No teachers assigned ⚠️
```

**Implementation:**
- Teachers are assigned AFTER time slots are finalized in Phase 3
- Algorithm attempts 2 teachers first, falls back to 1 if needed
- Unassigned labs are flagged in generation report for admin review

### 4.3 Lab Duration
**Rule:** Every lab session is exactly 2 hours (no exceptions).

**Example:**
```
✅ Valid: 8:30 AM - 10:30 AM (2 hours)
✅ Valid: 10:30 AM - 12:30 PM (2 hours)
❌ Invalid: 8:30 AM - 10:00 AM (1.5 hours)
❌ Invalid: 8:30 AM - 11:30 AM (3 hours)
```

**Implementation:**
- `syllabus_labs_model.js`: `duration_hours: { default: 2 }`
- Backend validation checks end_time - start_time = 120 minutes

### 4.4 Lab Subject Support
**Rule:** A physical lab room can support multiple syllabus labs based on equipment/software.

**Example:**
```
Lab Room ISE-301:
├── Equipment: General-purpose computers
├── Can Support:
│   ├── Data Structures Lab (DSL) ✅
│   ├── AI Lab ✅
│   └── Web Development Lab ✅
└── Cannot Support:
    └── Hardware Lab ❌ (requires special equipment)

Lab Room 612A:
├── Equipment: High-end graphics cards, visualization software
├── Can Support:
│   ├── Data Visualization Lab (DV) ✅
│   └── Data Visualization Project (DVP) ✅
└── Cannot Support:
    └── Basic programming labs ❌ (overkill, reserved for special needs)
```

**Implementation:**
- `dept_labs_model.js`: `lab_subjects_handled: [ObjectId]` (array of supported labs)
- UI filters lab rooms based on selected lab subject
- **Important:** Lab room assignment is FIXED in Phase 2, not Phase 3
- **Reason:** Equipment/software constraints require manual room selection

### 4.5 Lab Room Assignment Constraint
**Rule:** Lab rooms are automatically assigned in Phase 2 based on equipment compatibility and even distribution strategy.

**Reason:** 
- Lab rooms are constrained by equipment/software requirements
- Automatic assignment ensures even distribution across available rooms
- Minimizes conflicts during Phase 3 scheduling
- Teachers are assigned later in Phase 3 for maximum flexibility

**Automatic Assignment Strategy:**

**Step 1: Filter Compatible Rooms**
```
For each section's lab (e.g., Section 5A, DV Lab):
├── Query dept_labs where lab_subjects_handled includes "DV Lab"
├── Result: Compatible rooms [612A, 612B, 612C, 604A]
└── These rooms have required equipment (graphics cards, visualization software)

Example Filters:
DV Lab → Rooms: [612A, 612B, 612C, 604A] (4 rooms with graphics)
CN Lab → Rooms: [ISE-301, ISE-302, ISE-303, ISE-304] (4 general rooms)
DSL Lab → Rooms: [ISE-301, ISE-302, ISE-303, ISE-304, ISE-305] (5 general rooms)
```

**Step 2: Even Distribution (Round-Robin)**
```
For each section's lab, assign rooms to batches evenly:

Section 5A, DV Lab (3 batches):
Compatible Rooms: [612A, 612B, 612C, 604A]

Assignment:
├── Batch 5A1 → Room: 612A (rooms[0 % 4] = rooms[0])
├── Batch 5A2 → Room: 612B (rooms[1 % 4] = rooms[1])
└── Batch 5A3 → Room: 612C (rooms[2 % 4] = rooms[2])

Section 5B, DV Lab (3 batches):
Compatible Rooms: [612A, 612B, 612C, 604A]

Assignment:
├── Batch 5B1 → Room: 604A (rooms[3 % 4] = rooms[3]) ← Starts from next available
├── Batch 5B2 → Room: 612A (rooms[4 % 4] = rooms[0]) ← Wraps around
└── Batch 5B3 → Room: 612B (rooms[5 % 4] = rooms[1])

✅ Even distribution: Each room used roughly equally
✅ Minimizes conflicts: Different sections tend to get different rooms
```

**Step 3: Global Room Distribution Tracking**
```javascript
// Track global room usage across all sections
roomUsageCounter = {
  "612A": 0,
  "612B": 0,
  "612C": 0,
  "604A": 0
}

// For each batch assignment, pick least-used compatible room
function assignRoom(batch, lab, compatibleRooms) {
  // Sort rooms by usage count (ascending)
  sortedRooms = compatibleRooms.sort((a, b) => 
    roomUsageCounter[a] - roomUsageCounter[b]
  )
  
  // Pick least-used room
  assignedRoom = sortedRooms[0]
  roomUsageCounter[assignedRoom]++
  
  return assignedRoom
}

Result:
├── Batch 5A1, DV Lab → 612A (usage: 0 → 1)
├── Batch 5A2, DV Lab → 612B (usage: 0 → 1)
├── Batch 5A3, DV Lab → 612C (usage: 0 → 1)
├── Batch 5B1, DV Lab → 604A (usage: 0 → 1)
├── Batch 5B2, DV Lab → 612A (usage: 1 → 2) ← Least used
└── Batch 5B3, DV Lab → 612B (usage: 1 → 2)

✅ Fair distribution across all rooms
```

**Example Output:**
```
Phase 2 Automatic Room Assignments:

Section 5A:
├── Batch 5A1, CN Lab → Room: ISE-301 ✅
├── Batch 5A2, CN Lab → Room: ISE-302 ✅
├── Batch 5A3, CN Lab → Room: ISE-303 ✅
├── Batch 5A1, DV Lab → Room: 612A ✅
├── Batch 5A2, DV Lab → Room: 612B ✅
└── Batch 5A3, DV Lab → Room: 612C ✅

Section 5B:
├── Batch 5B1, CN Lab → Room: ISE-304 ✅ (next available)
├── Batch 5B2, CN Lab → Room: ISE-301 ✅ (wrap around)
├── Batch 5B3, CN Lab → Room: ISE-302 ✅
├── Batch 5B1, DV Lab → Room: 604A ✅ (next available)
├── Batch 5B2, DV Lab → Room: 612A ✅ (wrap around, least used)
└── Batch 5B3, DV Lab → Room: 612B ✅

All assignments automatically generated!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Automatic: No manual selection needed
- ✅ Equipment-compatible: Only assigns suitable rooms
- ✅ Even distribution: Rooms used fairly across sections
- ✅ Conflict minimization: Different sections likely get different rooms
- ✅ Predictable: Deterministic algorithm (repeatable results)
- ✅ Scalable: Works for any number of sections/labs/rooms

**Algorithm Implementation:**
- Location: `backend_server/algorithms/auto_lab_room_assignment.js`
- Functions:
  - `autoAssignLabRooms(semType, academicYear)` → Performs actual assignment & saves to DB
  - `previewLabRoomAssignments(semType, academicYear)` → Preview without saving (testing)

**Why Room Assignment Before Phase 3:**
1. Equipment constraints are hard (cannot be changed during scheduling)
2. Pre-assignment simplifies Phase 3 (only need to find time slots)
3. Even distribution prevents bottlenecks
4. Reduces Phase 3 complexity (fewer variables to optimize)

**Why Teachers NOT Assigned in Phase 2:**
1. Teacher availability varies with time slots (soft constraint)
2. Pre-assigning creates rigid constraints that reduce scheduling success
3. Dynamic assignment in Phase 3 maximizes flexibility
4. Teacher conflicts can be resolved by trying different teachers

### 4.6 Lab Shortforms
**Rule:** Every lab must have a shortform for compact display.

**Example:**
```
Lab: Data Structures Lab
├── Code: BCS303LAB
├── Shortform: DSL ✅
└── Display in UI: "DSL" instead of "BCS303LAB"
```

---

### 4.7 Weekly Lab Scheduling Requirements (CRITICAL!)
**Rule:** Every batch of a section MUST get ONE session of EACH lab assigned to that semester, scheduled within the weekly timetable.

**Example - Semester 5 Section A:**
```
Assigned Labs for Semester 5:
├── CN Lab (Computer Networks Lab)
└── DV Lab (Data Visualization Lab)

Weekly Timetable MUST include:
Section 5A:
├── Batch 5A1:
│   ├── CN Lab → One 2-hour session (e.g., Monday 8-10 AM)
│   └── DV Lab → One 2-hour session (e.g., Wednesday 2-4 PM)
│
├── Batch 5A2:
│   ├── CN Lab → One 2-hour session (e.g., Monday 8-10 AM)
│   └── DV Lab → One 2-hour session (e.g., Wednesday 2-4 PM)
│
└── Batch 5A3:
    ├── CN Lab → One 2-hour session (e.g., Monday 8-10 AM)
    └── DV Lab → One 2-hour session (e.g., Wednesday 2-4 PM)

✅ All 3 batches get BOTH labs in the week
```

**Parallel Lab Scheduling (Same OR Different Labs):**

**Scenario A: Same Lab in Parallel (Preferred when possible)**
```
Monday 8:00-10:00 - Section 5A:
├── Batch 5A1 → CN Lab → Room ISE-301 → Teachers: DC+AK
├── Batch 5A2 → CN Lab → Room ISE-302 → Teachers: Rajeev+Suman
└── Batch 5A3 → CN Lab → Room ISE-303 → Teachers: Arjun+Priya

✅ All batches doing SAME lab at SAME time (batch sync)
✅ Easier for students/teachers (uniform schedule)
```

**Scenario B: Different Labs in Parallel (When necessary)**
```
Wednesday 2:00-4:00 - Section 5A:
├── Batch 5A1 → DV Lab → Room 612A → Teachers: DC+AK
├── Batch 5A2 → CN Lab → Room ISE-302 → Teachers: Rajeev+Suman
└── Batch 5A3 → DSL Lab → Room ISE-301 → Teachers: Arjun+Priya

✅ All batches doing DIFFERENT labs at SAME time (batch sync maintained)
✅ Flexible - allows more scheduling options
```

**Algorithm Liberty:**
- ✅ Can schedule same lab for all batches in parallel
- ✅ Can schedule different labs for batches in parallel
- ✅ Choice based on:
  - Teacher availability
  - Room availability
  - Minimizing conflicts
  - Optimal time slot utilization

**Critical Constraint - Weekly Completeness:**
```
❌ INVALID: Batch 5A1 gets CN Lab but NOT DV Lab in the week
❌ INVALID: Batch 5A2 gets DV Lab twice but NO CN Lab
✅ VALID: Every batch gets exactly ONE session of EACH lab per week
```

**Implementation:**
- Algorithm must track: Which labs each batch has been assigned
- Before finalizing timetable: Verify all batches have all required labs
- Warning if any lab missing for any batch

---

### 4.8 No Consecutive Lab Sessions (CRITICAL!)
**Rule:** A section CANNOT have lab sessions in consecutive time slots on the same day.

**Reason:** Lab sessions are physically and mentally intensive. Students need a break or theory class between lab sessions for better learning and to avoid fatigue.

**Invalid Examples:**
```
❌ INVALID - Section 3A Schedule (Monday):
├── 8:00-10:00: Lab Session (DSL)
└── 10:00-12:00: Lab Session (DBMS Lab) ❌ CONSECUTIVE!

❌ INVALID - Section 5A Schedule (Tuesday):
├── 10:00-12:00: Lab Session (CN Lab)
└── 12:00-2:00: Lab Session (DV Lab) ❌ CONSECUTIVE!

❌ INVALID - Section 7A Schedule (Wednesday):
├── 2:00-4:00: Lab Session (AI Lab)
└── 4:00-6:00: Lab Session (ML Lab) ❌ CONSECUTIVE!
```

**Valid Examples:**
```
✅ VALID - Section 3A Schedule (Monday):
├── 8:00-10:00: Lab Session (DSL)
├── 10:00-10:30: Break
├── 10:30-12:30: Theory Class (Data Structures)
└── 2:00-4:00: Lab Session (DBMS Lab) ✅ (Not consecutive, gap with theory)

✅ VALID - Section 5A Schedule (Tuesday):
├── 8:00-10:00: Theory Class (AI)
├── 10:00-12:00: Lab Session (CN Lab) ✅
├── 12:00-1:00: Theory Class (DBMS)
└── 2:00-4:00: Lab Session (DV Lab) ✅ (Not consecutive, gap with theory)

✅ VALID - Section 7A Schedule (Wednesday):
├── 8:00-10:00: Lab Session (AI Lab)
├── 10:00-10:30: Break
├── 10:30-12:30: Theory Classes
├── 12:30-1:00: Break
└── 1:00-3:00: Theory Classes ✅ (No second lab session today)
```

**Definition of "Consecutive":**
```
Consecutive = Lab sessions with NO gap or ONLY a break (≤30 min) between them

Examples:
├── Lab 8-10, Lab 10-12 → ❌ Consecutive (no gap)
├── Lab 8-10, Break 10-10:30, Lab 10:30-12:30 → ❌ Consecutive (only break)
├── Lab 8-10, Theory 10-12, Lab 12-2 → ✅ Not consecutive (theory between)
└── Lab 8-10, Theory 10-10:30, Lab 10:30-12:30 → ✅ Not consecutive (theory between)
```

**Algorithm Validation:**
```javascript
function hasConsecutiveLabSessions(section, day, schedule) {
  const daySlots = schedule.filter(slot => slot.day === day)
  daySlots.sort((a, b) => a.start_time - b.start_time)
  
  for (let i = 0; i < daySlots.length - 1; i++) {
    const current = daySlots[i]
    const next = daySlots[i + 1]
    
    // Check if both are lab sessions
    if (current.type === 'lab' && next.type === 'lab') {
      // Check if they're consecutive (end time of current = start time of next)
      // OR only a short break (≤30 min) between them
      const gap = calculateGap(current.end_time, next.start_time)
      
      if (gap <= 30) {
        return true // ❌ Consecutive labs detected!
      }
    }
  }
  
  return false // ✅ No consecutive labs
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Before assigning a lab session, check if previous/next slot is also a lab
- If yes, ensure there's a theory class (>30 min) between them
- Reject assignment if it creates consecutive lab sessions
- Validation applies within same section's daily schedule

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Prevents student fatigue from continuous lab work
- ✅ Allows mental break between hands-on sessions
- ✅ Better learning outcomes with mixed schedule
- ✅ More realistic and humane timetable

---

## ⏰ **5. SCHEDULING CONSTRAINTS**

### 5.1 Batch Synchronization (CRITICAL!)
**Rule:** All batches of a section MUST be together in time doing SOME activity.

**Valid Scenarios:**

**Scenario A: Theory Class (All Together)**
```
Monday 10:30-12:30 - Section 3A:
All 60 students (3A1 + 3A2 + 3A3) → Data Structures Theory → ISE-LH1 → Prof. DC

✅ All batches physically together in ONE classroom
```

**Scenario B: Same Lab (Parallel Rooms)**
```
Monday 8:30-10:30 - Section 3A:
├── Batch 3A1 → DSL → Room ISE-301 → DC + AK
├── Batch 3A2 → DSL → Room ISE-302 → Rajeev + Suman
└── Batch 3A3 → DSL → Room ISE-303 → Arjun + Priya

✅ All batches doing SAME lab at SAME time in DIFFERENT rooms
```

**Scenario C: Different Labs (Parallel Rooms)** ⭐
```
Monday 8:30-10:30 - Section 3A:
├── Batch 3A1 → DSL → Room ISE-301 → DC + AK
├── Batch 3A2 → DBMS Lab → Room ISE-304 → Rajeev + Suman
└── Batch 3A3 → AI Lab → Room ISE-307 → Arjun + Priya

✅ All batches doing DIFFERENT labs at SAME time in DIFFERENT rooms
```

**Invalid Scenario:**
```
Monday 8:30-10:30 - Section 3A:
├── Batch 3A1 → DSL (lab)
├── Batch 3A2 → FREE TIME ❌
└── Batch 3A3 → Data Structures Theory ❌

❌ WRONG! One batch in lab, one free, one in theory at SAME time
```

**Key Points:**
- ✅ All batches must have **SAME start time** and **SAME end time**
- ✅ Theory: All together in ONE room
- ✅ Labs: All in labs (same OR different labs)
- ❌ Never: One batch busy, another free, another in different activity type

**Implementation:**
- `lab_session_model.js`: Groups all batches under single time slot
- Pre-save validation ensures all batches present
- Unique index: `(section_id, scheduled_day, scheduled_start_time)`

### 5.2 Working Hours and Time Structure
**Rule:** Classes operate within department working hours: 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday.

**Working Schedule:**
```
Days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
Hours: 8:00 AM - 5:00 PM (9 hours total per day)
Weekends: Saturday, Sunday (NO classes)
```

**Time Slot Flexibility:**
- ✅ Algorithm can allocate slots flexibly within 8 AM - 5 PM window
- ✅ Theory classes: Typically 1-2 hour blocks
- ✅ Labs: Always 2-hour blocks
- ✅ No fixed hourly boundaries (can start at 8:30, 9:15, 10:45, etc. as needed)

**Typical Time Structure (Example):**
```
08:00-09:00 → Slot 1 (1 hour)
09:00-10:00 → Slot 2 (1 hour)
10:00-10:30 → Short Break
10:30-11:30 → Slot 3 (1 hour)
11:30-12:30 → Slot 4 (1 hour)
12:30-01:30 → Lunch Break (1 hour)
01:30-02:30 → Slot 5 (1 hour)
02:30-03:30 → Slot 6 (1 hour)
03:30-04:30 → Slot 7 (1 hour)
04:30-05:00 → Buffer/End of day
```

**Note:** Actual time slot allocation is determined by algorithm during Phase 3 generation, within the 8 AM - 5 PM constraint.

### 5.3 Break Management (CRITICAL!)
**Rule:** Each section should have breaks distributed across the day, with specific constraints.

**Break Constraints:**

**1. Maximum Breaks Per Day:**
```
✅ Maximum: 2 breaks per day
✅ Minimum: 1 break per day (if schedule is very tight)
❌ Invalid: 3 or more breaks in one day
```

**2. Break Duration:**
```
✅ Each break: Exactly 30 minutes
❌ Invalid: 60 minutes (one-hour breaks not allowed)
❌ Invalid: 15 minutes (too short)
❌ Invalid: 45 minutes (too long)
```

**3. Break Distribution:**
```
Ideal Distribution:
├── Break 1: Before 12:00 noon (morning break)
└── Break 2: After 12:00 noon (afternoon break)

Example:
├── 8:00-10:00: Lab Session
├── 10:00-10:30: Break 1 (30 min) ✅ (before noon)
├── 10:30-12:00: Theory Class
├── 12:00-1:00: Theory Class
├── 1:00-1:30: Break 2 (30 min) ✅ (after noon)
└── 1:30-3:30: Lab Session
```

**4. Flexible Break Placement:**
```
Breaks are NOT fixed for all sections
- Section 3A might have breaks at: 10:00-10:30, 1:00-1:30
- Section 3B might have breaks at: 10:30-11:00, 2:00-2:30
- Section 5A might have breaks at: 9:30-10:00, 12:30-1:00

✅ Each section's breaks can be at different times
✅ Algorithm decides optimal break placement based on schedule
```

**5. Back-to-Back Classes Allowed:**
```
If schedule is tight, back-to-back classes are acceptable:

Example (Tight Schedule):
├── 8:00-10:00: Lab Session
├── 10:00-11:00: Theory Class (back-to-back) ✅
├── 11:00-12:00: Theory Class (back-to-back) ✅
├── 12:00-12:30: Break (30 min) ✅ (only 1 break today)
├── 12:30-2:30: Lab Session
└── 2:30-3:30: Theory Class (back-to-back) ✅

✅ Valid: Only 1 break, but acceptable if schedule requires it
```

**6. Avoid Excessive Gaps:**
```
While breaks are allowed, avoid idle gaps:

❌ Invalid:
├── 8:00-10:00: Theory Class
├── 10:00-11:00: GAP (60 min - too long!) ❌
└── 11:00-1:00: Lab Session

✅ Valid:
├── 8:00-10:00: Theory Class
├── 10:00-10:30: Break (30 min) ✅
├── 10:30-12:30: Lab Session
```

**Algorithm Strategy:**
```javascript
For each section's daily schedule:
  1. Identify natural break points (between classes)
  2. Try to place 1 break before 12:00 noon
  3. Try to place 1 break after 12:00 noon
  4. Each break = 30 minutes exactly
  5. If schedule is very tight:
     - Allow back-to-back classes
     - Use only 1 break (acceptable)
  6. Never exceed 2 breaks per day
  7. Avoid gaps > 30 minutes (unless it's a scheduled break)
```

**Break Representation in Timetable:**
```javascript
// Breaks are implicit (gaps between classes)
// Not explicitly stored as separate slots

Example:
theory_slots: [
  { start_time: "08:00", end_time: "10:00", ... },
  { start_time: "10:30", end_time: "12:00", ... }, // 30-min gap before = Break 1
  { start_time: "12:00", end_time: "13:00", ... },
  { start_time: "13:30", end_time: "15:30", ... }  // 30-min gap before = Break 2
]

Implied breaks:
├── 10:00-10:30: Break (before noon)
└── 13:00-13:30: Break (after noon)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Students get adequate rest (1-2 breaks per day)
- ✅ Breaks are short and efficient (30 min each)
- ✅ Flexible placement per section (not fixed college-wide)
- ✅ Maintains student engagement (no long idle periods)
- ✅ Accommodates tight schedules (back-to-back classes if needed)

**Reason:** Balances student wellbeing with efficient schedule utilization, prevents excessive idle time while ensuring adequate rest periods.

### 5.4 Fixed Time Slots for OEC and PEC (Semester 7 Only)
**Rule:** Open Elective Courses (OEC) and Professional Elective Courses (PEC) have PRE-DECIDED fixed time slots that must be honored.

**Input Required (Before Generation):**
```javascript
// Example input for Semester 7 electives
{
  oec_time_slot: {
    day: "Friday",
    start_time: "1:30 PM",
    end_time: "3:30 PM"
  },
  pec_time_slot: {
    day: "Monday", 
    start_time: "10:30 AM",
    end_time: "12:30 PM"
  }
}
```

**Algorithm Behavior:**
```
For Section 7A:
├── OEC: BLOCK Friday 1:30-3:30 PM (fixed, given as input)
│   ├── Reserve ISE classroom
│   ├── NO teacher assignment (external dept)
│   └── All batches together
│
└── PEC: BLOCK Monday 10:30-12:30 PM (fixed, given as input)
    ├── Reserve 3 ISE classrooms (for 3 elective options)
    ├── Assign 3 ISE teachers (one per option)
    └── All batches together (students distributed by choice)
```

**Reason:** 
- **OEC:** College-wide coordination requires fixed slots
- **PEC:** Parallel elective options require same time slot
- Pre-decided slots prevent scheduling conflicts

**Implementation:**
- Store fixed slots in database or configuration
- Algorithm marks these slots as "blocked" for Sem 7 sections
- No flexibility in time allocation for these subjects

### 5.5 Weekly Schedule Pattern
**Rule:** Classes run Monday through Friday only (no weekends).

**Working Days:** Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
**Non-Working Days:** Saturday, Sunday

**Implementation:**
- `lab_session_model.js`: `scheduled_day: { enum: ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday'] }`

---

## 👨‍🏫 **6. TEACHER CONSTRAINTS**

### 6.1 Teacher Capability Declaration
**Rule:** Teachers must declare which subjects and labs they CAN handle (Phase 1: Master Data).

**Example:**
```
Teacher: Prof. Deeksha Chandra (DC)
├── Can Teach Subjects:
│   ├── Data Structures (DS) ✅
│   ├── DBMS ✅
│   └── AI ✅
├── Can Handle Labs:
│   ├── Data Structures Lab (DSL) ✅
│   └── AI Lab ✅
└── Cannot Teach: Web Development ❌
```

**Implementation:**
- `teachers_models.js`: `canTeach_subjects: [ObjectId]`, `labs_handled: [ObjectId]`
- UI filters subjects/labs based on teacher capabilities

### 6.2 Teacher Assignment vs Capability
**Rule:** Teacher capability (Phase 1) ≠ Teacher assignment (Phase 2)

**Phase 1: Capability Declaration (One-Time Setup)**
```
Prof. DC CAN teach: DS, DBMS, AI
(Just indicating capability, not assigning specific sections)
```

**Phase 2: Actual Assignment (Per Semester)**
```
Prof. DC WILL teach this semester:
├── Data Structures → Section 3A ✅
├── DBMS → Section 3B ✅
└── AI → Not assigned this semester
```

**Reason:** Separates capability management from workload assignment, allows flexibility in scheduling.

### 6.3 Teacher Shortforms
**Rule:** Every teacher must have a shortform for compact display.

**Example:**
```
Teacher: Prof. Deeksha Chandra
├── Shortform: DC ✅
├── Display: "Prof. Deeksha Chandra (DC)"
└── Max Length: 5 characters
```

**Implementation:**
- `teachers_models.js`: `teacher_shortform: { type: String, maxlength: 5 }`
- UI input: Auto-uppercase, max 5 characters

### 6.4 No Teacher Conflicts
**Rule:** A teacher cannot be assigned to multiple classes at the same time.

**Example:**
```
Monday 8:30-10:30:
├── Section 3A: Data Structures → Prof. DC ✅
└── Section 3B: DBMS → Prof. DC ❌ (CONFLICT!)

❌ Prof. DC cannot teach two classes simultaneously
```

**Implementation:** Phase 3 algorithm must check teacher availability before scheduling.

---

## 🏫 **7. CLASSROOM CONSTRAINTS**

### 7.1 Theory Classroom Types
**Rule:** Theory classrooms are categorized by capacity and equipment.

**Example:**
```
Classroom: ISE-LH1 (Large Lecture Hall)
├── Capacity: 120 students (optional info)
├── Equipment: Projector, Audio System
└── Suitable for: Large sections

Classroom: ISE-601 (Regular Classroom)
├── Capacity: 60 students (optional info)
├── Equipment: Whiteboard
└── Suitable for: Standard sections
```

**Note:** Capacity is stored for informational purposes only, not used for validation or constraints.

### 7.2 Project Subjects - No Classroom
**Rule:** Project subjects do NOT require classroom assignment.

**Example:**
```
Subject: Major Project
├── Time Slot: Monday 1:30-3:30 ✅ (allocated)
├── Teacher: None ✅
└── Classroom: None ✅ (students work in labs/library/groups)
```

**Reason:** Project work is flexible, doesn't need fixed classroom space.

### 7.3 Classroom Auto-Uppercase
**Rule:** All classroom/lab room numbers must be stored in uppercase.

**Example:**
```
Input: "ise-lh1", "612a"
Stored: "ISE-LH1", "612A" ✅
```

**Implementation:** Frontend auto-converts input to uppercase before submission.

---

## 🔄 **8. ASSIGNMENT CONSTRAINTS**

### 8.1 Unique Assignment per Subject per Section
**Rule:** Each subject in a section can have only ONE teacher assigned.

**Example:**
```
✅ Valid:
Subject: Data Structures
Section: 3A
Teacher: Prof. DC

❌ Invalid:
Subject: Data Structures
Section: 3A
Teachers: Prof. DC AND Prof. AK (Cannot have 2 teachers for same subject-section)
```

**Implementation:**
- `pre_assign_teacher_model.js`: Unique index on `(subject_id, sem, sem_type, section)`

### 8.2 Lab Room Assignment per Batch
**Rule:** Each lab for a specific batch must have exactly ONE lab room assigned in Phase 2.

**Example:**
```
✅ Valid:
Lab: DSL
Batch: 3A1
Lab Room: ISE-301

❌ Invalid:
Lab: DSL
Batch: 3A1
Multiple Room Assignments:
├── Room: ISE-301
└── Room: ISE-302 (Duplicate!)
```

**Note:** Teachers are NOT assigned in Phase 2. They are dynamically assigned in Phase 3 after time slots are finalized.

**Implementation:**
- Unique index on `(lab_id, sem, sem_type, section, batch_number)`
- Only `assigned_lab_room` field required in Phase 2
- Teacher fields (`teacher1_id`, `teacher2_id`) added during Phase 3

### 8.3 Teacher Eligibility Check
**Rule:** Before assignment in Phase 3, verify teacher has declared capability for that lab.

**Example:**
```
Assignment Request (Phase 3):
├── Lab: Data Structures Lab (DSL)
├── Batch: 3A1
└── Candidate Teacher: Prof. DC

Check:
├── Does DC's labs_handled include "DSL"?
└── If NO → ❌ Skip this teacher, try next
    If YES → ✅ Assign teacher
```

**Implementation:** 
- Phase 3 algorithm filters teachers by capability before assignment
- No backend validation needed in Phase 2 (teachers not assigned yet)

---

## 📊 **9. DATA INTEGRITY CONSTRAINTS**

### 9.1 Semester Type Matching
**Rule:** Subjects/Labs must match the semester's odd/even type.

**Example:**
```
Semester 3 (Odd):
✅ Can have: Subjects with sem_type = "odd"
❌ Cannot have: Subjects with sem_type = "even"

Semester 4 (Even):
✅ Can have: Subjects with sem_type = "even"
❌ Cannot have: Subjects with sem_type = "odd"
```

**Implementation:** UI filters subjects/labs based on section's `sem_type`

### 9.2 Atomic Lab Sessions
**Rule:** Lab sessions must be saved atomically (all batches together or none).

**Reason:** Enforces "batches together in time" constraint at database level.

**Implementation:**
- `lab_session_model.js`: Single document contains ALL batch assignments
- Pre-save hook validates all batches present
- Cannot save partial sessions

### 9.3 No Orphaned Assignments
**Rule:** Assignments cannot exist without valid references to teachers, subjects, sections.

**Implementation:**
- MongoDB ObjectId references with foreign key constraints
- `ref: 'Teacher'`, `ref: 'Subjects'`, `ref: 'ISE_Sections'`
- Backend validation checks existence before creating assignments

### 9.4 Hours Per Week vs Credits
**Rule:** Use `hrs_per_week` field for workload calculations, not `credits`.

**Reason:** 
- `hrs_per_week` represents actual teaching time commitment
- `credits` is an academic metric, not operational
- Timetable generation needs actual hours, not credit values

**Example:**
```
Subject: Data Structures
├── hrs_per_week: 3 ✅ (3 hours of teaching per week)
├── credits: 4 (academic credits - informational only)
└── Use hrs_per_week for:
    ├── Teacher workload calculations
    ├── Timetable slot allocation
    └── Scheduling constraints
```

**Implementation:**
- Display `hrs_per_week` in assignment interfaces
- Use `hrs_per_week` for teacher workload analytics
- Hide `credits` from operational views (only show in subject master data)

**UI Display:**
```javascript
✅ CORRECT: "{subject.hrs_per_week} hrs/week"
❌ WRONG: "{subject.credits} credits"
```

---

## 🎯 **10. BUSINESS LOGIC CONSTRAINTS**

### 10.1 Three-Phase Workflow
**Rule:** Timetable generation follows strict phase sequence.

**Phase 1: Master Data (One-Time Setup)**
```
Input:
├── Teachers (with capabilities)
├── Subjects (with categorization)
├── Labs (with requirements)
├── Sections (with batches)
├── Classrooms (theory rooms)
└── Dept Labs (lab rooms)
```

**Phase 2: Assignments (Per Semester)**
```
Input:
├── Teacher-Subject Assignments (which teacher teaches which subject to which section)
└── Lab Room Assignments (FULLY AUTOMATIC based on equipment & even distribution)

AUTOMATIC LAB ROOM ASSIGNMENT:
Algorithm automatically assigns lab rooms based on:
1. Equipment compatibility (query dept_labs.lab_subjects_handled)
2. Even distribution (global room usage counter)
3. Round-robin allocation (spreads load across rooms)

Output: Assignment data (teachers for theory, rooms for labs, NO time slots yet)

Example - AUTOMATIC Room Assignment:
Section 5A, DV Lab (3 batches):
├── Query: dept_labs where "DV Lab" in lab_subjects_handled
├── Compatible Rooms: [612A, 612B, 612C, 604A]
├── Batch 5A1: Room 612A ✅ (auto-assigned, least used)
├── Batch 5A2: Room 612B ✅ (auto-assigned, next least used)
└── Batch 5A3: Room 612C ✅ (auto-assigned, next least used)

Section 5B, DV Lab (3 batches):
├── Batch 5B1: Room 604A ✅ (auto-assigned, next in rotation)
├── Batch 5B2: Room 612A ✅ (auto-assigned, wrap around)
└── Batch 5B3: Room 612B ✅ (auto-assigned, wrap around)

Benefits:
✅ No manual input needed
✅ Even distribution prevents bottlenecks
✅ Equipment-compatible rooms guaranteed
✅ Minimizes conflicts for Phase 3 scheduling

Status: Rooms FIXED (automatic), Teachers pending (Phase 3), Time slots pending (Phase 3)
```

**Phase 3: Timetable Generation (Automated)**
```
Input: Phase 2 assignments (theory teachers + lab rooms already decided)

Algorithm: 
├── Step 1: Find optimal TIME SLOTS for all activities
├── Step 2: Assign teachers to labs (2 if possible, 1 if needed)
└── Constraint satisfaction approach

Output: Complete timetable with time slots and lab teachers

Example:
Monday 8:30-10:30 - Section 5A:
├── Batch 5A1 → DV → Room 612A (from Phase 2) → Teachers: DC+AK (Phase 3)
├── Batch 5A2 → DV → Room 612B (from Phase 2) → Teachers: Rajeev+Suman (Phase 3)
└── Batch 5A3 → DV → Room 604A (from Phase 2) → Teachers: Arjun+Priya (Phase 3)

Algorithm decided:
├── Time slot: Monday 8:30-10:30
└── Lab teachers: Dynamically assigned based on availability
Everything else was decided in Phase 2
```

**Rule:** Cannot skip phases. Phase 2 needs Phase 1 data. Phase 3 needs Phase 2 data.

---

### 10.2 Pre-Generation Validation Checklist
**Rule:** Before starting Phase 3 generation, validate that Phase 2 assignments are complete.

**Validation Checks:**

**1. Regular Theory Subjects:**
```
For each section:
  For each regular theory subject (requires_teacher_assignment = true):
    ✅ Check: Has teacher been assigned?
    ❌ Missing: Flag as unassigned
```

**2. Lab Batch Assignments:**
```
For each section:
  For each lab in semester:
    For each batch (3 batches per section):
      ✅ Check: Lab room automatically assigned?
      ❌ Missing: Flag batch as unassigned (should not happen with automatic assignment)
      
Note: Room assignment is AUTOMATIC in Phase 2
      Algorithm ensures all batches get equipment-compatible rooms
      Teachers are NOT checked in Phase 2 validation
      (Teachers assigned dynamically in Phase 3)
```

**3. Professional Elective Courses (PEC - Sem 7 only):**
```
For each PEC option (if semester 7):
  ✅ Check: Has ISE teacher been assigned?
  ✅ Check: Fixed time slot defined?
  ❌ Missing: Flag PEC option as unassigned
```

**4. Other Department & Open Elective Subjects:**
```
For each Other Dept / OEC subject:
  ✅ Check: Marked as non-ISE teacher (no assignment needed)
  ✅ Check: Fixed time slots defined (for OEC in Sem 7)
  ℹ️ Info: These don't need teacher assignment, just slot reservation
```

**5. Project Subjects:**
```
For each project subject:
  ✅ Check: Marked as project (no teacher/classroom needed)
  ℹ️ Info: Only need time slot allocation
```

**User Interaction if Incomplete:**
```javascript
// If validation finds unassigned items:
{
  status: "incomplete",
  unassigned: {
    theory_subjects: [
      { section: "3A", subject: "Data Structures", reason: "No teacher assigned" }
    ],
    lab_rooms: [
      { section: "5A", batch: "5A2", lab: "CN Lab", reason: "No room assigned" },
      { section: "5A", batch: "5A3", lab: "DV Lab", reason: "No room assigned" }
    ],
    pec_options: [
      { option: "Advanced AI", reason: "No teacher assigned" }
    ]
  }
}

// Show to admin:
"⚠️ Phase 2 Incomplete! The following items are not assigned:
- Section 3A: Data Structures (no teacher)
- Section 5A, Batch 5A2: CN Lab (no room)
- Section 5A, Batch 5A3: DV Lab (no room)
- PEC: Advanced AI (no teacher)

Would you like to:
1. ❌ Cancel - Fix assignments first
2. ⚠️ Continue anyway - Generate timetable with gaps (not recommended)
```

**Algorithm Behavior if User Chooses "Continue Anyway":**
- Skip unassigned subjects/labs during generation
- Leave time slots empty for those items
- Mark as "Not Scheduled - Missing Assignment" in final timetable
- Generate workload report excluding unassigned items
- Lab teachers assigned dynamically in Phase 3 (even if rooms missing, will be flagged)

**Implementation:**
- Run validation API call before generation
- Display clear warning with list of missing items
- Allow admin to proceed with warning acknowledgment
- Log skipped items in generation report

### 10.3 Teacher Workload Calculation (Post-Generation)
**Rule:** After timetable generation, calculate actual hours worked per teacher for workload analysis.

**Calculation Formula:**

**Theory Hours:**
```javascript
For each teacher:
  theory_hours = Σ(subject.hrs_per_week) for all assigned subjects
  
Example - Prof. DC:
├── DS (Section 3A): 3 hrs/week
├── DBMS (Section 3B): 4 hrs/week
└── Theory Total: 7 hours
```

**Lab Hours:**
```javascript
For each teacher:
  lab_hours = Σ(2 hours × number_of_lab_sessions_assigned)
  
Note: Lab teachers are assigned in Phase 3 after time slots are finalized
  
Example - Prof. DC (after Phase 3 generation):
├── DSL (Batch 3A1): 2 hours (assigned as teacher1)
├── DSL (Batch 3B2): 2 hours (assigned as teacher2)
├── CN Lab (Batch 5A1): 2 hours (assigned as teacher1)
└── Lab Total: 6 hours
```

**Total Weekly Workload:**
```javascript
total_workload = theory_hours + lab_hours

Example - Prof. DC:
├── Theory: 7 hours
├── Labs: 6 hours
└── Total: 13 hours/week ✅
```

**Workload Report Format:**
```
Teacher: Prof. Deeksha Chandra (DC)

Theory Assignments:
├── DS (3A): 3 hrs/week
├── DBMS (3B): 4 hrs/week
└── Subtotal: 7 hours

Lab Assignments (Phase 3):
├── DSL - Batch 3A1: 2 hours (teacher1)
├── DSL - Batch 3B2: 2 hours (teacher2)
├── CN Lab - Batch 5A1: 2 hours (teacher1)
└── Subtotal: 6 hours

Note: Some labs may have only 1 teacher if 2nd unavailable

Total Weekly Workload: 13 hours
Status: ✅ Normal (Typical: 40-50 hrs/week for full-time faculty)
```

**Exclusions from Workload Count:**
- ❌ Project subjects (no continuous teaching)
- ❌ OEC subjects (handled separately, not ISE workload)
- ✅ PEC subjects (if ISE teacher assigned, count hrs_per_week)
- ❌ Other Dept subjects (not ISE teacher)

**Typical Workload Expectations:**
```
Full-time Faculty: 40-50 hours/week
├── Theory: 10-15 hours
├── Labs: 10-15 hours
├── Admin/Meetings: 10-15 hours
└── Research/Prep: 10-15 hours
```

**Implementation:**
- Generate after timetable finalization
- Display in admin dashboard
- Allow export to PDF/Excel
- Highlight teachers with very high/low workloads
- Admin can review and reassign if workload imbalanced

---

### 10.4 Subject Filtering by Assignment Requirement
**Rule:** Teachers should only see subjects that require ISE teacher assignment.

**Hidden from Teachers:**
- Project subjects (is_project = true)
- Open electives (requires_teacher_assignment = false)
- Non-ISE subjects (requires_teacher_assignment = false)

**Shown to Teachers:**
- Regular theory subjects (requires_teacher_assignment = true)

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const filteredSubjects = subjects.filter(subject => 
  subject.requires_teacher_assignment === true
)
```

---

### 10.5 Elective Constraint (Future)
**Rule:** Open electives have fixed schedules across all sections.

**Example:**
```
Open Elective: Machine Learning
├── Time: Fixed by college (e.g., Friday 1:30-3:30 PM)
├── All sections choosing this elective: Must attend at same time
└── Teacher: From another department (not ISE)
```

**Note:** Not yet implemented, planned for Phase 3.

---

## 🔍 **11. UI/UX CONSTRAINTS**

### 11.1 Debugging and Error Messages
**Rule:** Provide clear, actionable debugging information when filters return empty results.

**Implementation Pattern:**
```javascript
// Always log filter criteria and results
console.log('Filter Criteria:', { sem, sem_type })
console.log('Total Items:', items.length)
console.log('Filtered Items:', filteredItems.length)

// Show user-friendly empty state
if (filteredItems.length === 0) {
  return (
    <div className="empty-state">
      <p>⚠️ No items found</p>
      <p>Criteria: Semester {sem} - {sem_type}</p>
      <p>Troubleshooting:
        • Check if items exist for this semester
        • Verify field names match database schema
        • Check browser console for detailed logs
      </p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Silent failures are hard to debug
- Empty dropdowns confuse users
- Console logs help identify field name mismatches
- Clear messages guide users to solution

**Real Example from Development:**
```
Problem: Subject filter returned empty array
Reason: Used subject.sem instead of subject.subject_sem
Solution: Console logs revealed no subjects matched filter
Fix: Corrected field name to subject.subject_sem
```

### 11.2 Compact Button Selection
**Rule:** Use compact button UI with semester grouping for multi-select operations.

**Example: Teacher Subject Selection**
```
Semester 3:  [DS] [DBMS] [COA] [Math]  (Selected: 2)
Semester 5:  [AI] [CC] [CN] [SE]       (Selected: 1)
```

**Reason:** Reduces scrolling, improves visibility, semester-based organization aligns with academic structure.

### 11.3 Shortform Priority
**Rule:** Always display shortforms when available, fall back to codes if not.

**Display Logic:**
```javascript
{item.shortform || item.code}
// Example: "DS" instead of "BCS301"
```

### 11.4 Auto-Uppercase Inputs
**Rule:** Classroom/Lab room numbers must be auto-converted to uppercase.

**Implementation:**
```javascript
<input 
  style={{ textTransform: 'uppercase' }}
  onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value.toUpperCase())}
/>
```

### 11.5 Stats Dashboards
**Rule:** Every master data page should show summary statistics.

**Example:**
```
Teachers Page:
├── 📊 Total Teachers: 15
├── 📚 Total Subject Assignments: 45
└── 🧪 Total Lab Assignments: 30
```

**Reason:** Provides quick overview, helps administrators track completion status.

### 11.6 Workload Display - Hours Not Credits
**Rule:** Show `hrs_per_week` in assignment interfaces, not `credits`.

**Correct Display:**
```javascript
// In subject cards
<div className="subject-hours">{subject.hrs_per_week} hrs/week</div>

// In assignment tables
<td>{assignment.subject_id.hrs_per_week} hrs</td>

// In modal details
<div className="detail-row">
  <span className="label">Hours per Week:</span>
  <span className="value">{subject.hrs_per_week}</span>
</div>
```

**Wrong Display:**
```javascript
❌ <div>{subject.credits} credits</div>  // Don't show credits in operations
```

**Reason:**
- Credits are academic metrics (for transcripts)
- Hours per week are operational metrics (for scheduling)
- Teachers/admins need to see actual time commitment
- Workload calculations depend on hours, not credits

---

## 🚀 **12. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS**

### 12.1 Database Collections
**Required Collections:**
- `Teachers` - Faculty master data
- `Subjects` - Theory subject definitions
- `Syllabus_Labs` - Lab subject definitions
- `ISE_Sections` - Section and batch structure
- `Classrooms` - Theory classroom inventory

      issue: "Only 1 teacher assigned (ideal: 2)",
      severity: "warning"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Indexes:**
```javascript
// Unique: one timetable per section per semester type per academic year
{ section_id: 1, sem_type: 1, academic_year: 1 }, { unique: true }

// Query optimization: Find all timetables for a semester type
{ sem_type: 1, academic_year: 1 }

// Query optimization: Find timetable by section
{ section_id: 1 }
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ One document = one section's complete timetable
- ✅ Easy to retrieve individual section timetables
- ✅ Complete information for display/printing
- ✅ Metadata tracks generation quality
- ✅ Flagged sessions for admin review
- ✅ Historical tracking (by academic year)

### 12.3 Unique Indexes
**Required Unique Constraints:**
```javascript
// Prevent duplicate subjects
{ subject_code: 1, sem: 1 } // Unique

// Prevent duplicate labs
{ lab_code: 1, lab_sem: 1 } // Unique

// Prevent duplicate sections
{ sem: 1, sem_type: 1, section_name: 1 } // Unique

// Prevent duplicate subject assignments
{ subject_id: 1, sem: 1, sem_type: 1, section: 1 } // Unique

// Prevent duplicate lab room assignments per batch
{ lab_id: 1, sem: 1, sem_type: 1, section: 1, batch_number: 1 } // Unique

// Prevent duplicate lab sessions per time slot
{ section_id: 1, scheduled_day: 1, scheduled_start_time: 1 } // Unique

// Prevent duplicate timetables per section per semester type per year
{ section_id: 1, sem_type: 1, academic_year: 1 } // Unique
```

### 12.4 Pre-Save Validations
**Required Validations:**

**Lab Assignments:**
- Exactly 2 teachers per lab batch
- Teachers must have lab in `labs_handled`
- Lab room must support the lab subject

**Lab Sessions:**
- All batches of section must be present
- Batch names must match section's batch_names
- Each batch must have exactly 2 teachers
- End time > Start time
- Duration should be 2 hours (warning if not)

**Theory Assignments:**
- Teacher must have subject in `canTeach_subjects`
- One teacher per subject per section

**Teacher Workload:**
- Teacher workload is NOT pre-constrained by max hours per week
- Workload is naturally determined by Phase 2 assignments (subjects + labs assigned)
- Post-generation analytics will calculate actual hours worked per teacher
- Typical engineering teacher workload: 40-50 hours per week
- Admin can review workload report after generation and reassign if needed

## 🧠 **13. ALGORITHM CONSTRAINTS AND STRATEGIES**

### 13.1 Phase 2 Lab Room Assignment Algorithm
**Purpose:** Assign lab rooms to batches based on equipment compatibility.

**Algorithm Strategy:**
```javascript
For each section:
  For each syllabus lab:
    For each batch (1 to 3):
      1. Filter rooms by equipment compatibility (lab_subjects_handled)
      2. Use round-robin room assignment based on batch number
         → Batch 1: Room[0], Batch 2: Room[1], Batch 3: Room[2]
      3. Save assignment: (section, batch, lab, 1 room)
```

**Critical Insight - Room Rotation per Batch:**
```
Example: CN Lab for Section 5A
├── Batch 5A1 → Room: ISE-301 (rooms[0])
├── Batch 5A2 → Room: ISE-302 (rooms[1])
└── Batch 5A3 → Room: ISE-303 (rooms[2])

WHY: Ensures each batch gets a different room for the same lab
BENEFIT: No room conflicts when batches do same lab in parallel
```

**Room Assignment Strategy:**
- Filter rooms by lab support (`lab_subjects_handled` includes target lab)
- Sort rooms alphabetically for consistency
- Use modulo operator: `roomIndex = (batchNumber - 1) % suitableRooms.length`
- Ensures different rooms for different batches of same lab

**Output:** Complete `Lab_Room_Assignments` collection with all (section, batch, lab, room) combinations.

**Note:** Teachers are NOT assigned in Phase 2. They are dynamically assigned in Phase 3 after time slots are finalized.

---

### 13.2 Phase 3 Timetable Generation Algorithm (Greedy Builder)
**Purpose:** Find optimal TIME SLOTS for all theory subjects and labs, then assign teachers to labs.

**Algorithm Architecture:**
```
Phase 0: Greedy Initialization (Current Implementation)
├── Step A: Generate time slots for all activities
├── Step B: Assign teachers to labs dynamically
├── Fitness: ~-200 (minor violations acceptable)
└── Much better than random (~-900)

Phase 1: Genetic Algorithm (Future Implementation)
├── Evolve timetable through generations
├── Crossover + Mutation operators
└── Target fitness: ~-50 (few violations)

Phase 2: Bees Algorithm (Future Refinement)
├── Local search for fine-tuning
└── Target fitness: 0 (zero violations)
```

**Current Implementation: Greedy Builder Strategy**

**Step 1: Block Fixed Slots**
```javascript
// For Semester 7 only
Block OEC slots: { day: 'Friday', start: '13:30', end: '15:30' }
Block PEC slots: { day: 'Monday', start: '10:30', end: '12:30' }
// These slots are reserved, cannot be used for other activities
```

**Step 2: Schedule Labs (Hardest First)**
```javascript
// Labs scheduled before theory (less flexible - 2 hour blocks)
// NO TEACHERS ASSIGNED YET - only time slots and rooms

BATCH ROTATION STRATEGY (CRITICAL!):
For each time slot round:
  For each batch:
    labIndex = (round + batchIndex) % batch.labs.length
    Schedule: batch[labIndex] at this time slot

EXAMPLE: Section 5A has 2 labs (CN, DV)
Round 1:
├── Batch 5A1: CN Lab (labs[0]) → Room: ISE-301 (Phase 2)
├── Batch 5A2: DV Lab (labs[1]) → Room: 612B (Phase 2)
└── Batch 5A3: CN Lab (labs[0]) → Room: ISE-302 (Phase 2)

Round 2:
├── Batch 5A1: DV Lab (labs[1]) → Room: 612A (Phase 2)
├── Batch 5A2: CN Lab (labs[0]) → Room: ISE-303 (Phase 2)
└── Batch 5A3: DV Lab (labs[1]) → Room: 612C (Phase 2)

Result: All batches complete all labs, no duplicates!
Note: Rooms from Phase 2, Teachers assigned in Step 4
```

**Batch Rotation Formula:**
```javascript
labIndex = (currentRound + batchNumber) % totalLabs

Why this works:
- Each batch starts at different lab (offset by batch number)
- Each round, all batches rotate to next lab
- After totalLabs rounds, all batches completed all labs
- No conflicts since batches always in sync (same time slot)
```

**Lab Slot Selection Strategy:**
```javascript
Preferred lab times:
├── 08:00-10:00 (morning slot 1)
├── 10:00-12:00 (morning slot 2)
├── 14:00-16:00 (afternoon slot 1)
└── 16:00-18:00 (afternoon slot 2) [extends beyond 17:00, needs review]

Strategy:
1. Try Monday first, then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
2. For each day, try time slots in order
3. Pick first available (no room conflicts - rooms already assigned)
4. Teachers NOT checked yet (assigned in Step 4)
```

**Step 3: Schedule Theory (More Flexible)**
```javascript
Sort subjects by hrs_per_week (descending) - hardest first

For each theory subject:
  1. Split hours into sessions respecting max_hrs_per_day
     Example: 3 hrs/week, max 2/day → sessions [2, 1]
  
  2. For each session:
     - Calculate day load (hours already scheduled per day)
     - Sort available slots by day load (prefer least busy days)
     - Try slots in load-balanced order
     - Check conflicts (teacher, room, batch sync)
     - Pick first conflict-free slot
```

**Theory Hour Splitting Logic:**
```javascript
splitTheoryHours(hrsPerWeek, maxHrsPerDay):
  sessions = []
  remaining = hrsPerWeek
  
  while remaining > 0:
    sessionHours = min(remaining, maxHrsPerDay)
    sessions.push(sessionHours)
    remaining -= sessionHours
  
  return sessions

Examples:
- 3 hrs, max 2 → [2, 1]
- 4 hrs, max 2 → [2, 2]
- 5 hrs, max 2 → [2, 2, 1]
- 6 hrs, max 3 → [3, 3]
```

**Slot Availability Strategy - Load Balancing:**
```javascript
// Calculate current hours scheduled per day
hoursPerDay = { Mon: 0, Tue: 0, Wed: 0, Thu: 0, Fri: 0 }

For each existing slot:
  hoursPerDay[slot.day] += slot.duration

// Sort slots by:
// 1. Day load (ascending) - prefer less busy days
// 2. Time (ascending) - prefer earlier slots
sortedSlots = availableSlots.sort((a, b) => {
  if (hoursPerDay[a.day] !== hoursPerDay[b.day])
    return hoursPerDay[a.day] - hoursPerDay[b.day]
  return a.start_time - b.start_time
})

// Try slots in load-balanced order
```

**Step 4: Assign Teachers to Labs (After All Slots Finalized)**
```javascript
// All time slots are now finalized
// Now assign teachers to each lab session

For each lab_session in timetable:
  qualified_teachers = getQualifiedTeachers(lab_session.lab_id)
  // Filter teachers who have this lab in labs_handled
  
  available_teachers = qualified_teachers.filter(teacher => {
    return !hasConflict(teacher, lab_session.day, lab_session.start_time)
  })
  
  // Sort by current workload (ascending) - fair distribution
  available_teachers.sort((a, b) => a.workload - b.workload)
  
  // Try to assign 2 teachers (ideal)
  if (available_teachers.length >= 2) {
    lab_session.teacher1_id = available_teachers[0]
    lab_session.teacher2_id = available_teachers[1]
    lab_session.teacher_status = "2_teachers" ✅✅
  }
  // Fallback: Assign 1 teacher (acceptable)
  else if (available_teachers.length === 1) {
    lab_session.teacher1_id = available_teachers[0]
    lab_session.teacher2_id = null
    lab_session.teacher_status = "1_teacher" ✅
  }
  // No teachers available (flag for admin)
  else {
    lab_session.teacher1_id = null
    lab_session.teacher2_id = null
    lab_session.teacher_status = "no_teachers" ⚠️
    flagForReview.push(lab_session)
  }
```

**Teacher Assignment Report:**
```
Lab Teacher Assignment Summary:
├── Total Lab Sessions: 45
├── Sessions with 2 Teachers: 38 ✅✅ (84%)
├── Sessions with 1 Teacher: 5 ✅ (11%)
└── Sessions with 0 Teachers: 2 ⚠️ (5%) - Needs Admin Review

Flagged Sessions (Needs Review):
1. Section 5A, Batch 5A3, CN Lab, Monday 8:30-10:30
   → No qualified teachers available
   → Suggestion: Reassign time slot or add teacher capability

2. Section 7B, Batch 7B2, AI Lab, Friday 2:00-4:00
   → No qualified teachers available
   → Suggestion: Reassign time slot or add teacher capability
```

**Conflict Detection (Updated):**
```javascript
checkSlotConflicts(timetable, assignment, slot, type):
  
  // Type: 'theory' or 'lab'
  
  // Check 1: Teacher conflict (for theory only in Steps 1-3)
  - Teacher already teaching another subject at same time?
  - For labs: Teachers not checked during slot assignment (Step 2)
                Teachers checked during teacher assignment (Step 4)
  
  // Check 2: Room conflict
  - Room already occupied at same time?
  - For labs: Check assigned lab room (from Phase 2)
  - For theory: Check classroom
  
  // Check 3: Batch synchronization
  - Are all batches of section together in time?
  - For labs: All batches must be in labs (same or different)
  - For theory: All batches together in same classroom
  
  Return: true if conflict found, false if slot is free
```

**Working Hours Constraint:**
```javascript
WORKING_DAYS = ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday']
DAY_START = '08:00'
DAY_END = '17:00'

Generate time slots:
- 1-hour slots: 08:00-09:00, 09:00-10:00, ..., 16:00-17:00
- 2-hour slots: 08:00-10:00, 09:00-11:00, ..., 15:00-17:00

Note: Some lab slots extend to 18:00 (needs review for compliance)
```

**Output Structure:**
```javascript
Timetable {
  metadata: {
    created_by: 'greedy',
    generation: 0,
    fitness_score: -200 (approximate),
    teacher_assignment_summary: {

### 13.3 Validation Constraints

**Teacher Conflict Validator:**
```javascript
For each time slot:
  For each teacher:
    Count occurrences of teacher at this (day, start_time)
    If count > 1: CONFLICT! Teacher teaching multiple classes
```

**Room Conflict Validator:**
```javascript
For each time slot:
  For each room:
    Count occurrences of room at this (day, start_time)
    If count > 1: CONFLICT! Room double-booked
```

**Batch Synchronization Validator:**
```javascript
For each time slot (day, start_time):
  Get all activities for section at this time
  
  Check 1: Are all batches present?
  - Section has 3 batches → Must have 3 activities
  
  Check 2: Do all activities have same end time?
  - All must end at same time (batch sync)
  
  If violations found: CONFLICT! Batches not synchronized
```

### 13.4 Future Algorithm Enhancements (Phase 1 & 2)

**Genetic Algorithm (Phase 1):**
```
Population: 50-100 timetables
Generations: 100-500 iterations
Selection: Tournament selection (best 10%)
Crossover: Swap time slots between parents
Mutation: Randomly move 1-3 slots
Fitness Function: 
  - Hard constraints: -100 per violation (must be zero)
  - Soft constraints: -1 to -10 per violation (minimize)
Target: Fitness = 0 (zero violations)
```

**Bees Algorithm (Phase 2):**
```
Elite Sites: Top 5 timetables from GA
Scout Bees: Local search around elite sites
Neighborhood: ±30 min time shifts, room swaps
Exploitation: Refine best solutions
Exploration: Search for better alternatives
Target: Fine-tune to absolute zero violations
```

**Fitness Function Components (Future):**
```javascript
fitness_score = 0

// Hard Constraints (MUST be zero)
fitness_score -= teacher_conflicts * 100
fitness_score -= room_conflicts * 100
fitness_score -= batch_sync_violations * 100

// Soft Constraints (minimize)
fitness_score -= gaps_over_30min * 10
fitness_score -= unbalanced_days * 5
fitness_score -= late_classes_after_4pm * 3
fitness_score -= back_to_back_labs * 2

return fitness_score
```

## � **11.7 Schema-Route Field Consistency**

**Rule:** Database schema field names MUST exactly match populate path in routes.

**Example Problem:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Schema has 'classroom' but route uses 'classroom_id'
Schema: scheduled_slots: [{ classroom: ObjectId }]
Route:  .populate('scheduled_slots.classroom_id', 'room_no')
Error:  "Cannot populate path `scheduled_slots.classroom_id`"
```

**Correct Implementation:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Field names match
Schema: scheduled_slots: [{ classroom: ObjectId }]
Route:  .populate('scheduled_slots.classroom', 'room_no')
```

**Debugging:**
- Check exact field names in model definition
- Copy field names from schema to populate calls
- Error message will tell you which path failed to populate

---

## 🔄 **11.8 Update Payload Strategy for Unique Constraints**

**Rule:** When updating records with unique constraints, send ONLY the fields being changed.

**Problem:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Sends all fields including unchanged ones
PUT /api/teacher-assignments/:id
{
  teacher_id: "new_teacher",
  subject_id: "same_subject",  // Triggers unique constraint!
  sem: 3,
  sem_type: "odd",
  section: "A"
}
// Unique index on (subject_id, sem, sem_type, section) fails
```

**Solution:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Send only changed field
PUT /api/teacher-assignments/:id
{
  teacher_id: "new_teacher"  // Only this changed
}
// MongoDB updates only teacher_id, unique constraint happy
```

**Implementation Pattern:**
```javascript
// Frontend: Separate payloads for create vs update
if (isEditMode) {
  const updatePayload = { teacher_id: selectedTeacher }  // Only changes
  await axios.put(`/api/assignments/${id}`, updatePayload)
} else {
  const createPayload = {  // Full payload for creation
    teacher_id: selectedTeacher,
    subject_id: subject._id,
    sem: section.sem,
    sem_type: section.sem_type,
    section: section.section_name
  }
  await axios.post('/api/assignments', createPayload)
}
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Unique indexes check if combination already exists
- Sending unchanged fields makes MongoDB think you're creating duplicate
- `findByIdAndUpdate` with minimal payload bypasses constraint

---

## 📊 **11.9 Display Priority: Shortforms First**

**Rule:** Always display shortforms before full names for compact, consistent UI.

**Example:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Shows full name first
{assignment.teacher_id.name || assignment.teacher_id.teacher_shortform}
// Result: "Dr. Shilpa M" (long, inconsistent)

// ✅ CORRECT - Shows shortform first
{assignment.teacher_id.teacher_shortform || assignment.teacher_id.name}
// Result: "SMD" (compact, consistent)
```

**Rationale:**
- Shortforms save screen space
- Create visual consistency across cards
- Fallback to full name if shortform missing

**Apply Everywhere:**
- Teacher displays
- Subject displays  
- Lab displays
- Assignment cards
- Table cells

---

## 🔍 **11.10 Console Logging Strategy**

**Rule:** Add strategic console logs for debugging complex data flows.

**What to Log:**
```javascript
// Filter criteria and counts
console.log('=== DEBUG INFO ===')
console.log('Filter criteria:', { sem, sem_type, section })
console.log('Total items:', allItems.length)
console.log('Filtered items:', filteredItems.length)
console.log('Filtered items:', filteredItems.map(i => i.code))

// Assignment state changes
console.log('isEditMode:', isEditMode)
console.log('currentAssignment:', currentAssignment)
console.log('Payload:', payload)

// Backend route execution
console.log('=== PUT UPDATE ASSIGNMENT ===')
console.log('Request Body:', req.body)
console.log('Current Assignment:', currentAssignment)
```

**Best Practices:**
- Use clear section headers (`=== TITLE ===`)
- Log both inputs and outputs
- Include relevant context (IDs, codes, names)
- Remove logs after debugging (or add debug flag)

## �📝 **SUMMARY: CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS**

### Top 17 Most Important Constraints:

1. **Semester Scope:** Only semesters 3-8 (ISE responsibility)
2. **Semester Type Separation:** Odd and even sems completely separate, generated at different times
3. **Cross-Section Conflict-Free:** ALL sections globally conflict-free (teachers, rooms, classrooms)
4. **Individual Section Timetables:** Separate document per section, but generated in ONE algorithm run
5. **Batch Synchronization:** All batches of a section must be together in time (same OR different labs)
6. **Lab Teachers:** Ideal: 2 teachers per lab, Acceptable: 1 teacher, Flagged: 0 teachers (assigned in Phase 3)
7. **Lab Duration:** Always 2 hours (no exceptions)
8. **No Consecutive Labs:** Section cannot have lab sessions back-to-back on same day ⚠️ NEW
9. **Break Management:** 1-2 breaks per day (30 min each), try for one before/after noon ⚠️ NEW
10. **Lab Equipment Requirements:** Labs need specific rooms based on equipment/software
11. **Lab Room Assignment in Phase 2:** Rooms AUTOMATICALLY assigned (equipment compatibility + even distribution), Teachers in Phase 3
12. **Batch Rotation Strategy:** Batches rotate through labs using formula: `labIndex = (round + batchNumber) % totalLabs`
13. **Room Rotation per Batch:** Different batches get different rooms: `roomIndex = (batchNumber - 1) % suitableRooms.length`
14. **Teacher Assignment Flexibility:** Teachers assigned dynamically in Phase 3 after time slots finalized
15. **Project Subjects:** Time allocation only, no teacher/classroom assignment
16. **Batch Naming:** Include semester prefix (3A1, not A1)
17. **Three-Phase Workflow:** Master Data → Room Assignments → Generation (Time Slots + Lab Teachers)

### 🔧 Critical Implementation Details:

**Algorithm Strategies:**
- ⚠️ **Semester Type Separation:** Generate all odd OR all even semester sections in one run (never mixed)
- ⚠️ **Global Conflict Checking:** Check teacher/room/classroom availability across ALL sections before assignment
- ⚠️ **Individual Section Output:** Save separate timetable document per section (globally conflict-free)
- ⚠️ **Batch Rotation Formula:** `labIndex = (currentRound + batchNumber) % totalLabs` ensures all batches complete all labs
- ⚠️ **Room Distribution:** `roomIndex = (batchNumber - 1) % suitableRooms.length` prevents room conflicts in parallel
- ⚠️ **Load Balancing:** Algorithm sorts time slots by day load (ascending) to distribute workload evenly
- ⚠️ **Greedy Strategy:** Schedule hardest items first (labs before theory, high hrs_per_week first)
- ⚠️ **No Consecutive Labs:** Validate no back-to-back lab sessions for same section on same day
- ⚠️ **Break Management:** Ensure 1-2 breaks (30 min each) per day, distributed before/after noon
- ⚠️ **Teacher Assignment Post-Scheduling:** Teachers assigned AFTER all time slots finalized (Step 4)
- ⚠️ **Teacher Priority:** Try 2 teachers first, fall back to 1 if needed, flag if none available
- ⚠️ **Constraint Satisfaction:** Validate room conflicts, batch sync, consecutive labs during slot assignment

**Phase 2 Room Assignment:**
- ✅ Assigns only lab rooms based on equipment compatibility
- ✅ Fair distribution: Rotates rooms across batches
- ✅ Zero room conflicts guaranteed: Different batches get different rooms for same lab
- ✅ Output: Complete `Lab_Room_Assignments` collection ready for Phase 3
- ❌ No teacher assignment in Phase 2 (deferred to Phase 3 for flexibility)

**Phase 3 Greedy Builder:**
- ✅ Step 1: Block fixed slots (OEC/PEC in Sem 7)
- ✅ Step 2: Schedule labs using batch rotation strategy (rooms from Phase 2)
- ✅ Step 3: Schedule theory using load balancing and hour splitting
- ✅ Step 4: Assign teachers to labs (2 if possible, 1 if needed, flag if none)
- ✅ Result: Complete timetable with all slots + dynamic teacher assignments
- ✅ Report: Teacher assignment summary with flagged sessions
- 🔄 Future: Genetic Algorithm (Phase 1) and Bees Algorithm (Phase 2) will refine to fitness = 0

**Field Naming Convention:**
- ⚠️ Subjects use prefixed fields: `subject_sem`, `subject_sem_type` (NOT `sem`, `sem_type`)
- ⚠️ Always use full field names in filters to avoid silent failures
- ⚠️ Schema field names MUST match populate paths exactly (classroom not classroom_id)

**Workload vs Credits:**
- ✅ Use `hrs_per_week` for scheduling and workload calculations
- ❌ Don't use `credits` for operational decisions (academic metric only)
- Display hours/week in assignment interfaces, not credits

**Update Strategy:**
- ✅ For updates: Send ONLY changed fields to avoid unique constraint conflicts
- ✅ For creates: Send full required payload
- Different payloads for PUT vs POST operations

**Display Best Practices:**
- ✅ Always show shortforms before full names (compact, consistent)
- ✅ Use fallback chain: `shortform || name` or `shortform || code`
- ✅ Apply consistently across all UI components

**Debugging Best Practices:**
- Add console.log statements for filter criteria and results
- Show empty state messages with troubleshooting hints
- Verify field names match database schema exactly
- Log both request and response data for API calls

**Note:** Capacity fields (classroom/lab room/section students) are stored for informational purposes only and are NOT used for validation, scheduling, or any constraints.

**Critical Clarification:** Lab room assignments are FIXED in Phase 2 because different labs require different equipment/software. Phase 3 algorithm only finds TIME SLOTS, not room assignments.

**Workload Management:** Teacher workload is determined by Phase 2 assignments. Post-generation reports show actual hours worked (typically 40-50 hrs/week for full-time faculty). No upfront hour limits are enforced during assignment or generation.

**Capacity Fields:** Capacity information (classroom capacity, lab room capacity, section students) is stored for INFORMATIONAL purposes ONLY. NOT used for validation, assignment restrictions, or scheduling constraints. Algorithm ignores capacity completely.

## 🚀 **15. PHASE 3 IMPLEMENTATION STRUCTURE**

### 15.1 Optimized Algorithm Flow

**Your Proposed Approach:**
```
1. Fixed slots + classrooms ✅
2. Lab slots + rooms ✅
3. Theory slots + teachers + classrooms ✅
4. Lab teachers ✅
```

**✅ OPTIMIZED VERSION (with break handling & storage):**
```
1. Fixed slots (OEC/PEC) + classrooms [Sem 7 only]
2. Lab slots + rooms (auto-assigned in Phase 2)
   └─ Constraint: No consecutive labs for same section
3. Theory slots + teachers + classrooms
   └─ 3 slots per subject, respecting max_hrs_per_day
3.5. INSERT BREAKS (NEW STEP!)
   └─ Analyze schedule, insert 1-2 breaks per day (30 min each)
4. Assign Lab Teachers (dynamic, best effort)
   └─ Try 2 teachers, accept 1, flag 0
5. Validate & Save to timetable_model
   └─ ONE document per section
```

---

### 15.2 When Breaks Are Checked

**Answer: STEP 3.5 - After all slots placed, BEFORE validation**

**Why This Timing?**
- ❌ BAD: Check during slot placement → Too constraining
- ✅ GOOD: Insert after schedule built → See full day, place optimally

**Break Insertion Strategy:**
```javascript
For each day:
  1. Find natural gaps > 30 min → Mark as break
  2. Find back-to-back classes near noon → Insert break
  3. Ensure min 1, max 2 breaks per day
  4. Distribute: 1 before noon, 1 after noon (if possible)
```

---

### 15.3 When Timetable Is Stored

**Answer: STEP 5 - After complete validation**

**Storage Timing:**
```
❌ NOT STORED (In-Memory Only):
   - Steps 1-4: All operations on weeklyGrid object
   
✅ STORED TO DATABASE:
   - Step 5: After validation
   - Format: timetable_model document
   - One document = One section's complete week
```

**Storage Flow:**
```javascript
// In-Memory (Steps 1-4):
weeklyGrid = {
  Monday: [
    { type: 'theory', subject, teacher, classroom, time },
    { type: 'break', time: '10:00-10:30' },
    { type: 'lab', lab, batches: [...], rooms: [...], time }
  ],
  Tuesday: [...]
}

// Database (Step 5):
Timetable.create({
  section_id, sem_type, academic_year,
  theory_slots: [...],
  lab_slots: [...],
  breaks: [...],
  flagged_sessions: [...],
  generation_metadata: { generated_at, success_rate }
})
```

### 15.5 Global Conflict Tracking

**Problem:** Prevent teacher/room conflicts across sections

**Solution:** Maintain global availability trackers

```javascript
globalAvailability = {
  teachers: {
    'T101': [
      { day: 'Monday', start: '8:30', end: '10:00', section: '5A' },
      { day: 'Tuesday', start: '10:30', end: '12:30', section: '5B' }
    ]
  },
  classrooms: { 'CR1': [...] },
  labRooms: { 'ISE-301': [...] }
}

// Before assigning: Check global availability
isTeacherAvailable(teacherId, day, startTime, endTime)

// After assigning: Update global tracker
markTeacherOccupied(teacherId, day, startTime, endTime, section)
```
