feat: Multi-pass retry system with strict constraints

🎉 Major Achievement: 100% lab scheduling success for 3rd and 5th semesters

## Summary
- Overall success rate: 93% (25/27 labs)
- 3rd Semester: 15/15 labs (100%) ✅
- 5th Semester: 6/6 labs (100%) ✅
- 7th Semester: 4/6 labs (67%)

## Added
- Multi-Pass Retry System in step3_schedule_labs_v2.js
  * Attempts up to 20 different slot orderings
  * Fisher-Yates shuffle on slot combinations
  * Scoring prioritizes 3rd+5th semester: (sem3 + sem5) * 1000 + total
  * Early exit when perfect solution found
  * Typically finds optimal on FIRST attempt

- Room 613 to database (DBMS/AIML lab)
  * Successfully utilized by sections 3A, 3C, 7A, 7B
  * Helps distribute load across more rooms

- Enhanced diagnostic logging
  * Per-section success/failure tracking
  * Score calculation visibility
  * Room utilization tracking

## Changed
- Restored STRICT constraint enforcement
  * NO consecutive labs (no exceptions, even for final rounds)
  * Max 2 labs per day for ALL sections (removed tiered system)
  * Minimum 2-hour breaks between labs
  * Better student/faculty well-being

- Optimized processing order
  * Changed from: 3A → 3B → 3C → 5A → 5B → 5C → 7A → 7B → 7C
  * Changed to: 5A → 5B → 5C → 3A → 3B → 3C → 7A → 7B → 7C
  * Rationale: 5th semester (2 labs each) easier than 3rd (5 labs each)

## Fixed
- API return format bug
  * Problem: Frontend showed red error box after Step 3
  * Solution: Added applySchedulingResult() wrapper for proper API format
  * Result: Success alerts now display correctly

- Three consecutive labs issue
  * Problem: Relaxed constraints created 3 back-to-back labs
  * Solution: Enforced strict rules + multi-pass retry
  * Result: NO consecutive labs with 100% success for 3rd+5th

- Daily lab limit violations
  * Problem: Some sections had 3+ labs in one day
  * Solution: Enforced max 2 labs/day for all sections

## Performance
Before Multi-Pass (Greedy):
  3rd: 14/15 (93%), 5th: 5/6 (83%), 7th: 0/6 (0%)
  Total: 19/27 (70%)

After Multi-Pass + Strict Constraints:
  3rd: 15/15 (100%) ✅, 5th: 6/6 (100%) ✅, 7th: 4/6 (67%)
  Total: 25/27 (93%)

Constraints:
  ✅ NO consecutive labs
  ✅ Max 2 labs/day
  ✅ 2-hour breaks enforced
  ✅ Batch rotation guaranteed

## Known Issues
- 7C Section: 0/2 labs (PC Lab, BDA Lab)
  * Root Cause: Insufficient PC/BDA compatible rooms in database
  * Solution Required: Add more PC/BDA lab rooms

## Documentation
- Added MULTI_PASS_RETRY_SYSTEM.md - complete guide to retry architecture
- Updated CHANGELOG.md with Nov 12 entries
- Updated LAB_SCHEDULING.md with success metrics
- Updated ALGORITHM_STRATEGY.md with multi-pass approach
- Updated README.md with current performance stats

## Breaking Changes
- Consecutive lab constraint now STRICT (no exceptions)
- Daily limit now max 2 labs for ALL sections
- API response structure changed internally (frontend unaffected)

## Technical Details
- Multi-Pass Runtime: ~2-3 seconds for 20 attempts
- Early Exit: Often finds perfect solution in 1st attempt
- Randomization: Fisher-Yates shuffle on slot orderings
- Constraint Checking: 30-minute granularity prevents all time conflicts
